This repository contains a military hovercraft object with its water scum (in two different 
files) that you can use for free for any purpose ( commercial, educational or personal use ) 
with the POVRay raytracer, that you can download on this web site: https://www.povray.org
	
All the objects use modern 'srgb color' system from POVRay. There is a demo scene. I tried 
as much as possible to prefix every sub parts of the objects to avoid collisions with any other 
previous declarations in a scene.
